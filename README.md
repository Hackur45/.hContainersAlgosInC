# My C Coding Environment Repository

## Background ðŸ˜…

I started coding in C during my first year of college. As I got better, I realized I needed tools like containers and algorithms. Not knowing about the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, I decided to make my own `.h` files to help with coding tasks. Looking back, itâ€™s a bit embarrassing not to have known about these alternatives, but this experience is special because it led to my very first repository. ðŸ˜„
