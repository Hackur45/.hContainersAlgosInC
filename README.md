# This repository I have implemented to set my coding enviornment in C.

## Short StoryðŸ˜…

  Actually when I was in first year of my college I started coding in C.
  I got better day by bit I felt lack of containers and algorithms, as at
  that time I was completely unaware about Standard Template libraries in C++.
  So I became smart and made my own .h files for such assisting things while coding. 
  Though this is very embarassing for me not knowing about  alternatives for my priblems at that time. Though this is embracing as this is my first Repository.ðŸ˜„
